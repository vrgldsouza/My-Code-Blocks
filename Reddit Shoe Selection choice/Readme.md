The idea was to use Reddit to understand what type of shoe, best fits my daily needs. The subreddit used here was r/RunningShoeGeeks, I liked that subreddit, as the comments and posts get quiet technical.
For security reasons the reddit API connection won't be shared, but I will share the data extraction part.
