This Project was done in collaboration with Saskatoon Attridge drive Co-op team. The Problem that faced the store was the inability to accurately predict Sales for SKU's.
Co-op has over 10,000+ SKUâ€™s, with the store having an average daily spend of $10K just on FMCG products. Current Inventory ordering is done by utilizing the years of experience the senior supervisors have on the consumer behaviour and promotional offers for the week/month.
Therefore, our main problem statement was to predict inventory order point, by forecasting products at SKU level using ARIMA (Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average) and XGBoost (Extreme Gradient Boosting)
